to fix error 500.19
	
	Open IIS Management, Under the main server node, select open Feature Delegation (in Management section)

	"Handler Mappings" to "Read/Write" instead of "Read Only"

	It looks like your hosting provider unnecessarily locked down IIS.

	I was able to recreate the problem on my local IIS 7.5 server.

	See this for a global settings reset.
